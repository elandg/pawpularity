# pawpularity

Flexible notebook for training and testing various CNN classifiers provided by PyTorch. The dataset comes from a Kaggle competition called "Pawpularity", where ratings are assigned to images of pets. The idea is to help provide adoption agencies with feedback so that they can best showcase their cats and dogs that are looking for homes.

This is my first personal project with some code taken from online and some from a previous machine learning course. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!
